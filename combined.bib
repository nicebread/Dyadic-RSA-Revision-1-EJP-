  ABSTRACT = {Data collected from both members of a dyad provide abundant opportunities as well as data analytic challenges. The Actor–Partner Interdependence Model (APIM; Kashy \& Kenny, 2000) was developed as a conceptual framework for collecting and analyzing dyadic data, primarily by stressing the importance of considering the interdependence that exists between dyad members. The goal of this paper is to detail how the APIM can be implemented in dyadic research, and how its effects can be estimated using hierarchical linear modeling, including PROC MIXED in SAS and HLM (version 5.04; Raudenbush, Bryk, Cheong, \& Congdon, 2001). The paper describes the APIM and illustrates how the data set must be structured to use the data analytic methods proposed. It also presents the syntax needed to estimate the model, indicates how several types of interactions can be tested, and describes how the output can be interpreted.},

  ABSTRACT = {(from the chapter) Research on the effects of person-environment (PE) fit reflects three overriding assumptions. First, it is generally assumed that PE fit leads to positive outcomes. Second, it is often assumed that the effects of PE fit are the same across different person and environment constructs. Third, it is widely assumed that the effects of PE fit are the same regardless of the absolute levels of the person and environment or the direction of their difference. In this chapter, we outline an approach to conceptualizing the effects of PE fit that probes those assumptions. The conceptual approach we describe is intended to encourage PE fit researchers to critically examine assumptions that characterize the investigation of the effects of PE fit on outcomes, with the ultimate goal of advancing our collective understanding of PE fit. Our goal is to demonstrate a general approach to theorizing the effects of PE fit that can be applied and extended in various specific streams of PE fit research. Although some aspects of our presentation suggest hypotheses to be tested, our chief objective is to provide some initial conceptual spadework that delves into assumptions that underlie PE fit research, with the hope that these assumptions will be further probed in future PE fit research.

  title = {Testing Fit Patterns with Polynomial Regression Models},
  url = {https://osf.io/ndggf},
  abstract = {Fit hypotheses, also labeled `congruence', `discrepancy', or `congruity' hypotheses, contain the notion that an outcome is optimal when two predictor variables match well, while incongruent/ discrepant combinations of the predictors lead to a suboptimal outcome. Previous statistical frameworks for analyzing fit hypotheses emphasized the necessity of commensurable scales, which means that both predictors must be measured on the same content dimension and on the same numerical scale. In some research areas, however, it is impossible to achieve scale equivalence, because the predictors have to be measured with di$\carriagereturn$erent methods, such as ex- plicit attitudes (e.g., questionnaires) and implicit attitudes (e.g., reaction time task). In this paper, I di$\carriagereturn$erentiate numerical congruence from fit patterns, a concept that does not depend on the notion of commensurability, and hence can be applied to fit hypotheses with incom- mensurable scales. Polynomial regression can be used to test for the presence of a fit pattern in empirical data. I propose several new regression models for testing fit patterns which are statistically simpler and conceptually more meaningful than a full polynomial model. An R package is introduced which provides user-friendly functions for the computation, visualiza- tion, and model comparison of several fit patterns. An empirical example on implicit/explicit motive fit demonstrates the usage of the new methods.},

  ABSTRACT = {There is a growing interest among personality psychologists in the processes underlying the social consequences of personality. To adequately tackle this issue, complex designs and sophisticated mathematical models must be employed. In this article, we describe established and novel statistical approaches to examine social consequences of personality for individual, dyadic and group (round-robin and network) data. Our overview includes response surface analysis (RSA), autoregressive path models and latent growth curve models for individual data; actor-partner interdependence models and dyadic RSAs for dyadic data; and social relations and social network analysis for round-robin and network data. Altogether, our goal is to provide an overview of various analytical approaches, the situations in which each can be employed and a first impression about how to interpret their results. Three demo data sets and scripts show how to implement the approaches in R. Copyright © 2015 European Association of Personality Psychology},

@BOOK{burnham_model_2002,
  ABSTRACT = {We wrote this book to introduce graduate students and research workers in various scienti?c disciplines to the use of information-theoretic approaches in the analysis of empirical data. These methods allow the data-based selection of a “best” model and a ranking and weighting of the remaining models in a pre-de?ned set. Traditional statistical inference can then be based on this selected best model. However, we now emphasize that information-theoretic approaches allow formal inference to be based on more than one model (m- timodel inference). Such procedures lead to more robust inferences in many cases, and we advocate these approaches throughout the book. The second edition was prepared with three goals in mind. First, we have tried to improve the presentation of the material. Boxes now highlight ess- tial expressions and points. Some reorganization has been done to improve the ?ow of concepts, and a new chapter has been added. Chapters 2 and 4 have been streamlined in view of the detailed theory provided in Chapter 7. S- ond, concepts related to making formal inferences from more than one model (multimodel inference) have been emphasized throughout the book, but p- ticularly in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Third, new technical material has been added to Chapters 5 and 6. Well over 100 new references to the technical literature are given. These changes result primarily from our experiences while giving several seminars, workshops, and graduate courses on material in the ?rst e- tion.},

The authors blend both theory and application to equip readers with an understanding of the basic principles needed to apply regression model-building techniques in various fields of study, including engineering, management, and the health sciences.Following a general introduction to regression modeling, including typical applications, a host of technical tools are outlined such as basic inference procedures, introductory aspects of model adequacy checking, and polynomial regression models and their variations. The book then discusses how transformations and weighted least squares can be used to resolve problems of model inadequacy and also how to deal with influential observations. The Fifth Edition features numerous newly added topics, including:A chapter on regression analysis of time series data that presents the Durbin-Watson test and other techniques for detecting autocorrelation as well as parameter estimation in time series regression modelsRegression models with random effects in addition to a discussion on subsampling and the importance of the mixed modelTests on individual regression coefficients and subsets of coefficientsExamples of current uses of simple linear regression models and the use of multiple regression models for understanding patient satisfaction dataIn addition to Minitab, SAS, and S-PLUS, the authors have incorporated JMP and the freely available R software to illustrate the discussed techniques and procedures in this new edition. Numerous exercises have been added throughout, allowing readers to test their understanding of the material, and a related FTP site features the presented data sets, extensive problem solutions, software hints, and PowerPoint slides to facilitate instructional use of the book.Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis, Fifth Edition is an excellent book for statistics and engineering courses on regression at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels.

Of the 5 estimation methods, it was found that overall the methods based on maximum likelihood estimation and the Bayesian approach performed best in terms of bias, root-mean-square error, standard error ratios, power, and Type I error control, although key differences were observed. Similarities as well as disparities among methods are highlight and general recommendations articulated. As a point of comparison, all 5 approaches were fit to a reparameterized version of the latent quadratic model to educational reading data.

We discuss correlational methods for dyads when each dyad contains two different types of individuals (e.g., a husband and wife, a mother and child, or an expert and a novice). In such dyadic interaction designs, the dyad members are said to be distinguishable. We present a method for computing the overall correlation for distinguishable dyads, and we discuss a model for separating the dyad-level and individual-level components of such a correlation. The computational techniques and their interpretation are described using data from 98 heterosexual couples.},

In either approach, it is possible to include auxiliary variables solely for the purpose of improving the missing data procedure. A simulation was presented to assess the potential costs and benefits of a restrictive strategy, which makes minimal use of auxiliary variables, versus an inclusive strategy, which makes liberal use of such variables. The simulation showed that the inclusive strategy is to be greatly preferred. With an inclusive strategy not only is there a reduced chance of inadvertently omitting an important cause of missingness, there is also the possibility of noticeable gains in terms of increased efficiency and reduced bias, with only minor costs. As implemented in currently available software, the ML approach tends to encourage the use of a restrictive strategy, whereas the MI approach makes it relatively simple to use an inclusive strategy.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {Polynomial regression with response surface analysis is a sophisticated statistical approach that has become increasingly popular in multisource feedback research (e.g., self-observer rating discrepancy). The approach allows researchers to examine the extent to which combinations of two predictor variables relate to an outcome variable, particularly in the case when the discrepancy (difference) between the two predictor variables is a central consideration. We believe this approach has potential for application to a wide variety of research questions. To enhance interest and use of this technique, we provide ideas for future research directions that might benefit from the application of this analytic tool. We also walk through a step-by-step example of how to conduct polynomial regression and response surface analysis and provide all the tools you will need to do the analyses and graph the results (including SPSS syntax, formulas, and a downloadable Excel spreadsheet). Our example involves how discrepancies in perceived supervisor and organizational support relate to affective commitment. Finally, we discuss how this approach is a better, more informative alternative to difference scores and can be applied to the examination of two-way interactions in moderated regression.},

Previous discussions of this discrepancy have considered responsible factors including differences in measurement error and use of nonlinear scales. This article demonstrates that the differential efficiency of experimental and field tests of interactions is also attributable to the differential residual variances of such interactions once the component main effects have been partialed out.The authors derive an expression for this residual variance in terms of the joint distribution of the component variables and explore how properties of the distribution affect the efficiency of tests of moderator effects. The authors show that tests of interactions in field studies will often have less than 20% of the efficiency of optimal experimental tests and discuss implications for the design of field studies.}, number={2}, journal={Psychological Bulletin}, author={McClelland, G.

However, past research on personality similarity in couples has reported inconsistent findings. The current study employs a dyadic polynomial regression approach to take into account linear and curvilinear associations between similarity and satisfaction. The concurrent results based on data of 237 couples suggest that beyond actor effects for neuroticism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness and partner effects for agreeableness, similarity plays a negligible role for relationship satisfaction. Longitudinally, two similarity effects emerged. First, if partners reported dissimilar neuroticism levels, male partner reported lower relationship satisfaction. Second, if both partners reported modest levels in openness, female partners reported higher relationship satisfaction. Implications for couples are discussed.}, journal={Journal of Research in Personality}, author={Weidmann, Rebekka and Schönbrodt, Felix D. and Ledermann, Thomas and Grob, Alexander}, year={2017}}

The present study explored the links between person-city personality fit and self-esteem. Using data from 543,934 residents of 860 U.S. cities, we examined the extent to which the fit between individuals’ Big Five personality traits and the Big Five traits of the city where they live (i.e., the prevalent traits of the city’s inhabitants) predicts individuals’ self-esteem. To provide a benchmark for these effects, we also estimated the degree to which the fit between person and city religiosity predicts individuals’ self-esteem. The results provided a nuanced picture of the effects of person-city personality fit on self-esteem: We found significant but small effects of fit on self-esteem only for openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, rather than effects for all Big Five traits. Similar results and effect sizes were observed for religiosity. We conclude with a discussion of the relevance and limitations of this study.}, number={3}, journal={Psychological Science}, author={Bleidorn, Wiebke and Schönbrodt, Felix and Gebauer, Jochen E. and Rentfrow, Peter J. and Potter, Jeff and Gosling, Samuel D.}, year={2016}, month={Mar}, pages={419–427}}

The current article describes response surface analysis (RSA), an approach designed to answer questions about how (mis)matching predictors relate to outcomes while avoiding many of the statistical limitations of alternative, often-used approaches. We explain how RSA provides compressive and often more valid answers to questions about (mis)matching predictors than traditional approaches provide, outline steps on how to use RSA (including modifiable syntax), and demonstrate how to interpret RSA output with an example. To bolster our argument that RSA overcomes many limitations of traditional approaches (i.e., incomplete or misleading inferences), we compare results from four popular approaches (i.e., difference scores, residuals, moderated regression, and the truth and bias model) to those obtained from RSA. We discuss specific applications of RSA to social and personality psychology research.}, number={4}, journal={Social Psychological and Personality Science}, author={Barranti, Maxwell and Carlson, Erika N. and Côté, Stéphane}, year={2017}, month={May}, pages={465–475}}
